          This paainitng stood out to me the most becasue one, it looked
          beautiful and two, it spoke out to me. After a lot of researching I
          stil to this day can't find the name of it. Even lookign at the
          description tag of it at the museum all I could find was the artist
          who is named Woody Gwyn, and something about Manzano/Primavera, 2022.

          Now for the important part and the whole reason of making this website
          in the first place, what it meant to me. At a first glance anyone
          would look at it for a moment and mostly think that it is just pretty,
          that's what I did at first too, but then after a while I started to
          think about it, what does it mean to me? And then thats when I noticed
          it, on the top right corner of the canvas I noticed that the sky was
          visible, but on teh top left corner had no sky and was blocked by the
          flowers. Then as I looked at the bottom of both of the sides I also
          noticed that on the left side it was beautiful and the grass was as
          green as it can be, however on teh right side I saw that the grass was
          green at first but then got drier afterwards. So to me I felt like it
          was portraying freedom. The right side of the painting was teh freedom
          side since the sky was visible but just barely, but teh left side was
          teh side where there was no freedom. I came to this conclusion because
          to me I felt like the left side was showing how the road is pretty but
          you won't gain freedom if you stay in that comfort zone. On the right
          side the path looks pretty good at first but then gets harder as you
          progress increasingly into freedom, or the sky. Like if you stay in
          your comfort zone then it will look good but you will never realy have
          access to that freedom. On the right side if you take the path that
          doesn't look pretty but if you keep going, then that freedom will soon
          be yours.No matter how the path looks at teh end it will all be worth
          it when you have truly gained freedom.
