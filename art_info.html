          This painting stood out to me the most because, first, it looked
          beautiful, and second, it spoke to me. The painting was made by the
          artist who is named Woody Gwyn, and theis painting is titled
          Manzano/Primavera.

          Now for the important part and the whole reason for making this
          website in the first place: what it meant to me. At first glance,
          anyone would look at it for a moment and mostly think that it is just
          pretty—that’s what I did at first too. But then, after a while, I
          started to think about it: what does it mean to me? And then that’s
          when I noticed it. On the top right corner of the canvas, I noticed
          that the sky was visible, but on the top left corner, it had no sky
          and was blocked by the flowers. As I looked at the bottom of both
          sides, I also noticed that on the left side, it was beautiful, and the
          grass was as green as it could be. However, on the right side, I saw
          that the grass was green at first but then became drier afterwards. So
          to me, I felt like it was portraying freedom. The right side of the
          painting was the freedom side since the sky was visible but just
          barely, whereas the left side was the side where there was no freedom.
          I came to this conclusion because, to me, I felt like the left side
          was showing how the road is pretty but you won't gain freedom if you
          stay in that comfort zone. On the right side, the path looks pretty
          good at first but then gets harder as you progress increasingly into
          freedom, or the sky. If you stay in your comfort zone, it may look
          good, but you will never truly have access to that freedom. On the
          right side, if you take the path that doesn’t look pretty but if you
          keep going, then that freedom will soon be yours. No matter how the
          path looks in the end, it will all be worth it when you have truly
          gained freedom.
